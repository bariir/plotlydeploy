## Overview of Belly Button Biodiversity

Roza who is a biological researcher on a prominent microbiology laboratory is studying Belly Button biodiversity and wants to create dynamic visualization charts that tell her research story in a dynamic way. She wants to present her findings on a website that is a available to the public such as GitHub pages. She created three dynamic charts including a Horizontal Bar chart, a Bubble chart, and a Gauge chart. She has complete panel for demographic information and wants to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.

## Tools and Software: 
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, Git Bash to commit changes into GitHub Repository, GitHub Pages, D3 and Plotly. 


# Results
Roza’s goal is to identify top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) in the volunteers’ belly buttons when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 

- The dropdown menu will display the individual id numbers and demographic information when you select the test subject id. This selection will dynamically reflect to the rest of the visualization charts.<br>

- The horizontal bar chart will display the sample values, the bacterial species (OTUs) and the labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.<br>

- The gauge chart displays the weekly washing frequency’s value, and displays the value as a measure from 0 to 10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu. <br>

- The bubble chart will display the OTU ID values on the x-axis, the sample values on the y-axis, the sample values as the marker size, Ids as the marker colors and the labels s the hover-text values.<br>

- Custom dashboard that displays all the dynamic charts including dropdown menu, top 10 bacteria bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart. It also has image background and additional titles as well as white font on the jumbotron<br>
